I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, 
I would make peace with all. 
I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and 
rage the likes of which you would not believe. 
If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.
-Mary Shelley 

This is the Hour of Lead –
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow –
First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go –
-Emily Dickinson
